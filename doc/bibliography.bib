	abstract = {Generative probabilistic models emerge as a new paradigm in data-driven, evolution-informed design of biomolecular sequences. This paper introduces a novel approach, called Edge Activation Direct Coupling Analysis ({eaDCA}), tailored to the characteristics of {RNA} sequences, with a strong emphasis on simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability. {eaDCA} explicitly constructs sparse coevolutionary models for {RNA} families, achieving performance levels comparable to more complex methods while utilizing a significantly lower number of parameters. Our approach demonstrates efficiency in generating artificial {RNA} sequences that closely resemble their natural counterparts in both statistical analyses and {SHAPE}-{MaP} experiments, and in predicting the effect of mutations. Notably, {eaDCA} provides a unique feature: estimating the number of potential functional sequences within a given {RNA} family. For example, in the case of cyclic di-{AMP} riboswitches ({RF}00379), our analysis suggests the existence of approximately 1039 functional nucleotide sequences. While huge compared to the known \&lt;4000 natural sequences, this number represents only a tiny fraction of the vast pool of nearly 1082 possible nucleotide sequences of the same length (136 nucleotides). These results underscore the promise of sparse and interpretable generative models, such as {eaDCA}, in enhancing our understanding of the expansive {RNA} sequence space.},

	abstract = {Boltzmann machines ({BMs}) are widely used as generative models. For example, pairwise Potts models ({PMs}), which are instances of the {BM} class, provide accurate statistical models of families of evolutionarily related protein sequences. Their parameters are the local fields, which describe site-specific patterns of amino acid conservation, and the two-site couplings, which mirror the coevolution between pairs of sites. This coevolution reflects structural and functional constraints acting on protein sequences during evolution. The most conservative choice to describe the coevolution signal is to include all possible two-site couplings into the {PM}. This choice, typical of what is known as Direct Coupling Analysis, has been successful for predicting residue contacts in the three-dimensional structure, mutational effects, and generating new functional sequences. However, the resulting {PM} suffers from important overfitting effects: many couplings are small, noisy, and hardly interpretable; the {PM} is close to a critical point, meaning that it is highly sensitive to small parameter perturbations. In this work, we introduce a general parameter-reduction procedure for {BMs}, via a controlled iterative decimation of the less statistically significant couplings, identified by an information-based criterion that selects either weak or statistically unsupported couplings. For several protein families, our procedure allows one to remove more than 90\% of the {PM} couplings, while preserving the predictive and generative properties of the original dense {PM}, and the resulting model is far away from criticality, hence more robust to noise.},

Thanks to modern sequencing techniques, sequence data accumulate at unprecedented pace. This provides large sets of so-called homologous, i.e. evolutionarily related protein sequences, to which methods of inverse statistical physics can be applied. Using sequence data as the basis for the inference of Boltzmann distributions from samples of microscopic configurations or observables, it is possible to extract information about evolutionary constraints and thus protein function and structure. Here we give an overview over some biologically important questions, and how statistical-mechanics inspired modeling approaches can help to answer them. Finally, we discuss some open questions, which we expect to be addressed over the next years.},

	abstract = {Global coevolutionary models of homologous protein families, as constructed by direct coupling analysis ({DCA}), have recently gained popularity in particular due to their capacity to accurately predict residue–residue contacts from sequence information alone, and thereby to facilitate tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. More recently, they have also been used to predict fitness effects of amino-acid substitutions in proteins, and to predict evolutionary conserved protein–protein interactions. These models are based on two currently unjustified hypotheses: 1) correlations in the amino-acid usage of different positions are resulting collectively from networks of direct couplings; and 2) pairwise couplings are sufficient to capture the amino-acid variability. Here, we propose a highly precise inference scheme based on Boltzmann-machine learning, which allows us to systematically address these hypotheses. We show how correlations are built up in a highly collective way by a large number of coupling paths, which are based on the proteins three-dimensional structure. We further find that pairwise coevolutionary models capture the collective residue variability across homologous proteins even for quantities which are not imposed by the inference procedure, like three-residue correlations, the clustered structure of protein families in sequence space or the sequence distances between homologs. These findings strongly suggest that pairwise coevolutionary models are actually sufficient to accurately capture the residue variability in homologous protein families.},

	abstract = {Spatially proximate amino acids in a protein tend to coevolve. A protein's three-dimensional (3D) structure hence leaves an echo of correlations in the evolutionary record. Reverse engineering 3D structures from such correlations is an open problem in structural biology, pursued with increasing vigor as more and more protein sequences continue to fill the data banks. Within this task lies a statistical inference problem, rooted in the following: correlation between two sites in a protein sequence can arise from firsthand interaction but can also be network-propagated via intermediate sites; observed correlation is not enough to guarantee proximity. To separate direct from indirect interactions is an instance of the general problem of inverse statistical mechanics, where the task is to learn model parameters (fields, couplings) from observables (magnetizations, correlations, samples) in large systems. In the context of protein sequences, the approach has been referred to as direct-coupling analysis. Here we show that the pseudolikelihood method, applied to 21-state Potts models describing the statistical properties of families of evolutionarily related proteins, significantly outperforms existing approaches to the direct-coupling analysis, the latter being based on standard mean-field techniques. This improved performance also relies on a modified score for the coupling strength. The results are verified using known crystal structures of specific sequence instances of various protein families. Code implementing the new method can be found at http://plmdca.csc.kth.se/.},

The {RDF}2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The {LFASTA} program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of {DNA} or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.},

	abstract = {Correlation patterns in multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins can be exploited to infer information on the three-dimensional structure of their members. The typical pipeline to address this task, which we in this paper refer to as the three dimensions of contact prediction, is to (i) filter and align the raw sequence data representing the evolutionarily related proteins; (ii) choose a predictive model to describe a sequence alignment; (iii) infer the model parameters and interpret them in terms of structural properties, such as an accurate contact map. We show here that all three dimensions are important for overall prediction success. In particular, we show that it is possible to improve significantly along the second dimension by going beyond the pair-wise Potts models from statistical physics, which have hitherto been the focus of the field. These (simple) extensions are motivated by multiple sequence alignments often containing long stretches of gaps which, as a data feature, would be rather untypical for independent samples drawn from a Potts model. Using a large test set of proteins we show that the combined improvements along the three dimensions are as large as any reported to date.},
